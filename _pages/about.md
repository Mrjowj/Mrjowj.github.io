# About Me

Just call me mrjo — and no, it has nothing to do with the Joker.

I’m currently a junior university student, and I’m quite interested in low-level stuff in the IT field (though to be honest, I haven’t studied much of it yet).

I enjoy playing video games and often find myself captivated by their artistic styles.

Hopefully, this site will motivate me to stay on track and spend more time diving into IT topics.

# Addition:

我会三种语言，分别是中、英、日，然后现在在找实习（哭了）。

I speak three languages: Chinese, English, and Japanese.
Currently looking for an internship (send help 😢).

中国語・英語・日本語の三か国語が話せます。
今、絶賛インターン探し中です（泣）。
