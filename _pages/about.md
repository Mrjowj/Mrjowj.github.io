Just call me **mrjo** — and no, it has nothing to do with the Joker.

I’m currently a junior university student studying computer science in Japan.  
Though I still have much to learn, I’m especially drawn to low-level systems, performance optimization, and the fascinating world where computing meets art.

In my free time, I enjoy playing video games and often find inspiration from their mechanics and visual styles.  
Creating technical projects that merge graphics, simulation, and performance has become something I genuinely enjoy.

### 🌏 Multilingual Background

I speak three languages:
- **Chinese** (native)
- **English** (academic/professional level)
- **Japanese** (daily and technical use)

Currently on the hunt for an internship — any leads would be greatly appreciated 😢  
目前正在寻找实习机会——如果您有推荐，非常感谢！🙏  
現在、インターンを探しています。何か情報があれば本当に助かります…（泣）

Hopefully this site will help me stay motivated and focused on building meaningful technical skills.  
Thanks for visiting!
